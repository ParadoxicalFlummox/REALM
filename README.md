## Combined Feature Vision: Inspired by AppFolio & QuickBooks

REALM is designed to bring together the best of property management (like AppFolio) and accounting (like Intuit QuickBooks) into a single, seamless platform for small landlords.

### Property Management Features (AppFolio-inspired)
- Online rent collection and payment tracking
- Tenant and lease management (applications, screening, renewals)
- Maintenance request tracking and vendor management
- Vacancy marketing and listing syndication
- Owner and tenant portals for communication and document sharing
- Automated late fees, reminders, and reporting
- Accounting tools tailored for property management (bank reconciliation, trust accounting)

### Accounting Features (QuickBooks-inspired)
- Comprehensive income and expense tracking
- Invoicing, billing, and payment processing
- Bank account and credit card integration for automatic transaction import
- Financial reporting (profit & loss, balance sheet, cash flow)
- Receipt capture and document management
- Tax preparation tools and integration with tax filing services
- Payroll management (planned for future versions)

### The REALM Advantage
By combining these features, REALM offers:
- End-to-end property and tenant management
- Automated, accurate financial tracking and reporting
- Streamlined rent collection and expense management
- Integrated receipt/document storage for tax and audit readiness
- Marketing and communication tools for landlords and tenants
- A single dashboard for all property, financial, and compliance needs

## Deployment & Containerization

REALM is being developed with modern deployment in mind. The application will be fully containerized, allowing small landlords and property managers to easily deploy and run the platform using Docker or Kubernetes (K8s). This ensures:

- **Easy Setup**: Launch the entire stack with a single command using Docker Compose or Kubernetes manifests.
- **Portability**: Run REALM on any cloud provider, on-premises server, or even a local machine.
- **Scalability**: Effortlessly scale services as your portfolio grows.
- **Security**: Isolate services and manage secrets securely.

Deployment resources (Dockerfiles, docker-compose.yml, and K8s manifests) will be provided as the project matures.

## Development Timeline & Person Hours

As a solo developer, the following are estimated person hours and timeline for each major phase, assuming 5-10 hours per week of development:

| Phase                              | Estimated Hours | Estimated Duration |
|-------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| MVP (Core ledger, financials, receipts) | 80              | 2-4 months        |
| Valuation Integration               | 30              | 1-2 months        |
| Marketing Tools                     | 40              | 1-2 months        |
| Mobile App (Core features)          | 60              | 2-3 months        |
| Advanced Financial Tracking         | 50              | 1-2 months        |
| Deployment & Containerization       | 20              | 2-3 weeks         |
| **Total**                           | **280**         | **8-14 months**   |

> **Note:** These are rough estimates and actual time may vary based on feature complexity, learning curve, and unforeseen challenges. Timelines assume part-time development (5-10 hours/week). Increasing weekly hours will reduce the overall duration.
